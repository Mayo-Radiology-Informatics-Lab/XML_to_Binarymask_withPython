# XML_to_Binarymask_withPython
This script helps to create binary mask files from XML based on the color of annotation. If you want to change the color of annotation, refer to another code in my repository for XML modification.

Provide the folder paths:
xml_path= '.../Test_xml_path/'
file_path = r".../Test_svsfiles/"
mask_output =r".../Mak_out"
